# news-classification-and-prediction
A machine learning model that classifies news articles into categories like business, politics, sports, technology, and entertainment  using only the headline as input. Built using Python, scikit-learn, and Naive Bayes, the model predicts the type of news from short text and allows users to enter their own headlines for instant category prediction.
